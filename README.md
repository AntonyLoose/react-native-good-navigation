# react-native-good-navigation
An implementation of react-native stack that allows screens to be added and navigated to at runtime

An implementation of the React Native Stack Navigator that enables dynamic screen addition and navigation at runtime. 
By simply calling a method using the NavigationSession singleton, you can navigate to a screen; the session then dynamically 
adds the screen to the stack and publishes state to re-render the screen, facilitating seamless navigation experiences.

Responsive Design: It renders a tab bar on mobile and a sidebar on web and tablet, aligning more with native applications and enhancing 
user experiences by offering a consistent and responsive navigation interface.
